# mobileApp
I want to create an app which I could use to find the free public parking places on roads nearby any location. It would be great if I could use an interface like google maps where I could write the adress or the name of a known building and to select a range in which to find parking places( in walking minutes to the place I want or in distance). The app should update it's informations at a proper interval during the trip to the wanted place. This are the main features but it would be great if you can search based on you car size so that if you have a big car the parking place is still big enough and vice-versa, if you have a really small car you can find more parking places. More info about that parking place would be great to, info as prices or hours limit (policies of that parking spot).
